Project Title     -> Learnify
Selected Domain   -> Web Development
Problem Statement ->students often navigate multiple platforms for academic learning and coding skill development, which can 
                    lead to a fragmented experience . Traditional LMS systems lack interactive coding resources and real-time 
                    feedback mechanisms.

 Abstract :- students often use different platforms for studying and practicing coding, which makes learning disconnected and 
            less effective. Traditional learning systems focus more on theory and don’t offer hands-on coding practice or 
            instant feedback. This creates a gap between what students learn in class and the skills they need for jobs.
                     To solve this, students need a single, interactive platform that combines academic learning with coding 
            exercises, real-time feedback, and job preparation tools. Such a system would help students understand concepts 
            better, improve their coding skills, and get ready for placements—all in one place.
